# CUSTOMERS_BANKING_QUESTIONS







This project’s goal was to create a first-level automated filtering system for a bank’s on- line
customer service that would use machine learning to determine the subject matter of a question.
A dataset containing sample questions and the topics they were related to was made available. To
determine if a question relates to “card inquiries or issues”, “re- quires troubleshooting”, “top up
queries or issues,” or “other”, a prediction is made using several machine learning algorithms. K-
Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,
and PCA were just a few of the machine learning models that were trained and put to the test.
The Decision Tree model had the highest accuracy after hyperparameter adjustment (76%).
